Design app to do the following:

    - get email & attachmnet from outlook

    - combine excel file with existing 
        --- Now instead of combining. I am now modifying downloaded file 

    - upload completed excel file to network drive/sharepoint


Outstanding tasks/bugs:
    - which email attachmnet to grab? 
        --current set to grab all emails from folder 
    - when to get attachmnet? get the latest one delivered once every day? 
    - when/how to execute python. Automatically? Scheduled Tasks? 
    - compiled package install for blanket computer 
    - getting mail while existing excel file is open fails 

Additional feats:  
    - delete attachmnet downloaded and only present completed compiled
